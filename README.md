# bash_theory

This repo is full of sample code and explination for my theorm on shell
scripting, to include style guide.

Being GNU/Linux native, I preffer BASH as my shell, and bash is very widely
portable, and now runs on all modern platforms. By all Modern, all extant BSDs,
GNU, Windows, Darwin(apple products) are all known to feature bash. It is
available for android, maemo, and others. It is compiled from a single source
rather than many, often inconsistent supposed bourne and posix-sh compliant
shells.
